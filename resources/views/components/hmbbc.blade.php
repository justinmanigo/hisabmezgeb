    <p>This will let a user to add a begining balance.</p> <br><br>
    <p>
        Beginning Balance:- value will be added on Normal Balance Side only. The opposit side will be 
        disabled (as showen in the picture below).
    </p><br><br>
    <p>
        Note that Beginning Balance is only one record. Only 1 record (Sheet) will be available
        in the system.
        For Example, as I tried to show you above, the first one is the “First Beginning Balance”
        entered to the system, the second one is when user click “Beginning Balance” button for the 
        second time, and it will open the first record as it is, then the user will update 
        Account# 2000 & Account #6101. Remember that when saving the updated record, it will check 
        again if Total Debit == Total Credit as usual.
